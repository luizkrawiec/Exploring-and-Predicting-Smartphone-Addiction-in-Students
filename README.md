# 📱 Exploring and Predicting Smartphone Addiction in Students

This project analyzes and predicts smartphone addiction among students using a real-world dataset. We perform both **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and a **machine learning classification model** to uncover behavioral patterns and assess mental health risks related to excessive phone usage.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Survey data containing behavioral, psychological, and demographic variables related to smartphone use.
- **Goal**: Identify whether a student is addicted to their phone based on multiple features and provide actionable insights.
- **Approach**:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
  - Feature engineering
  - Classification using Random Forest and GridSearchCV
  - Performance evaluation using accuracy, F1-score, ROC AUC
  - Feature importance analysis
  - Final recommendations for reducing smartphone addiction

---

## 🧠 Key Insights from EDA

- Strong correlation between overuse of social media and indicators of stress and poor sleep quality.
- Addicted students tend to spend more hours on their phones daily and report difficulty concentrating.
- Self-perceived mental health is lower among those with signs of phone addiction.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Results

- **Model**: Random Forest Classifier with hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
- **Accuracy**: 99%
- **F1-Score**: 0.99
- **ROC AUC Score**: 0.998
- The model successfully distinguished between addicted and non-addicted students with high confidence.

## 📌 Recommendations

Based on the insights gained, we suggest:

- 📴 **Digital detox routines**: Encourage regular breaks from screens and social media apps.
- 🕐 **Screen time monitoring**: Use apps or built-in tools to limit usage.
- 🌿 **Mental health support**: Offer workshops, therapy access, or mindfulness programs in schools/universities.
- 📶 **Tech-free zones**: Promote time and space away from mobile devices (e.g., during meals or before sleep).
- 🧘 **Alternative activities**: Encourage offline hobbies, physical activity, or group interactions to reduce phone dependence.
